home:
  meta:
    title: "Home"
    description: "Welcome to the documentation for the framework @idrinth/api-bench"
  title: "What does this project do?"
  what: "This project provides a framework for testing rest-APIs and websites for  changes in response times."
  why: "This helps to detect performance changes in code in a quick and simple manner."
  demo:
    youtube: "Version 2.7.4 Demo"
  benchmark:
    title: "Why use a Benchmark Runner?"
    microservices: "Given that the amount of APIs increase by moving to microservices, we need a way to determine if changes to a service's response times are related to code changes."
    purpose: "For this purpose a defined load with repeatable requests with a medium amount of checks seems the most useful."
  load-test:
    title: "Why use a Load Test Runner?"
    microservices: "For planning and scaling purposes, we need to know how many users we can handle with a given amount of microservice instances."
    purpose: "For this purpose a defined growing load with repeatable requests with few checks seems the most useful."
  content-test:
    title: "Why use a Content Test Runner?"
    microservices: "With the amount of APIs skyrocketing, the need to test them quickly and with as little effort as possible is required."
    purpose: "For this purpose repeatable requests with many checks seems the most useful."
  libraries:
    title: "Regarding existing libraries"
    description: "Other tools are all either untouched for quite a while and don't provide type definitions for typescript. This makes them less desirable when working with projects where the better static code check is a huge boost in development speed."
    reusability: "A huge benefit of using this framework is writing route definitions once and reusing them across all desired test types."
    threading: "Additionally, this tool separates the validation thread from the thread processing the actual requests to further minimise the effect of complicated validations or huge response bodies on the data gathering."
