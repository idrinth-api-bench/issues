# @idrinth/api-bench/mindmap

This mindmap is hosted [here](https://mindmap.idrinth-api-ben.ch).

To add or edit the mindmap, have a look at the data.yml file. It is made up of
nodes - the single elements - that all start from the root node.

Node can contain three elements: text, url and children. Text is required to
actually be able to display the  node, while children and url  are optional.
If children is set, these child nodes will be connected to their parent, if url
is  set, the  node will contain a link to that url.

Use children to break apart  a point and use the url if there is a source of
information for that specific topic  or it otherwise makes sense.
